# urban-place-recognition
This is my final bachelor project. It is divided into three parts:

# Part 1
The first part is the back-end of the project, which loads a pre-trained classifier and responds to users' requests using the Flask library. There are also crawler modules that gather images from social media such as Instagram using location tags.

# Part 2
The second part is the front-end of the project, which developed using Angular and has several pages.

# Part 3
The third part is the deep learning model; in this section, the ResNet model is trained using Transfer Learning using gathered images of Tehran places in the crawling phase.
